## Running Tests

This project uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as the test runner, [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) for assertions, and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for integration test like functionality.

To run your tests, run the following from your terminal

`$ open test/foods-test.html`

This will open and execute the tests in your browser
